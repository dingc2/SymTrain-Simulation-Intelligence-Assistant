This case for Marty Juana has taken forever, what is the underwriter waiting on? Trainee: Hi Norm, may I start with a policy number to get started? SYM: This case for Marty Juana has taken forever, what is the underwriter waiting on? The policy number is T195129. Trainee: Thank you, Norm. Give me one moment to pull up the case. Trainee: Thank you, Norm, I do have Marty's case pulled up here. You would like to talk about what will move this case to approval, is that correct? SYM: Yes, that is what I'm looking for. Trainee: Please give me a moment so I can review the details of the case and see what we can do to get this moving. SYM: Sounds good! Trainee: Thank you so much, I am all up to speed on this case. It looks like we are awaiting records from Dr. Smith's office and that a special authorization was sent to your office by the APS vendor to be reviewed. Do you have a copy of that completed form? SYM: No, I thought you sent it to the client and not just to me. Trainee: Thank you, Norm. Let me take a moment to review the notes from our APS vendor to determine where the document was sent. SYM: Please do, I hope you sent it to the client. Trainee: It doesn't appear that this was sent directly to the client, instead it was sent to your office to facilitate that request. I can have that resent to you right away. SYM: Ok, that is fine. Do you really need these records though? It's been a long time. Trainee: It does look from the notes that the underwriter does require these notes in order to reach the final decision, however, I will put in a note requesting for a risk review and the underwriter will reach out with that information. In the meantime, I'll get the form over to you to reduce any further delay. SYM: That sounds fair. Thank you. Trainee: Of course. Is there anything else I can assist you with? SYM: No, that was all. Trainee: Awesome, well thank you so much for putting your trust in Northwestern Mutual. Have a great rest of your day. SYM: Thank you, you as well!\""
