This is Norm Weston calling from John Barrett's office. This case for Marty Juana has taken forever, what is the underwriter waiting on? Trainee: Hi Norm, may I start with a policy number to get started? SYM: This case for Marty Juana has taken forever, what is the underwriter waiting on? The policy number is T195129. Trainee: Thank you, Norm. Give me one moment to pull up the case. Trainee: Thank you, Norm, I do have Marty's case pulled up here. You would like to talk about what will move this case to approval, is that correct? SYM: Yes, that is what I'm looking for. Trainee: Please give me a moment so I can review the details of the case and see what we can do to get this moving. SYM: Sounds good! Trainee: Thank you so much, I am all up to speed on this case. It looks like we are awaiting records from Dr. Smith's office and that a special authorization was sent to your office by the APS vendor to be reviewed. Do you have a copy of that completed form? SYM: No, I thought you sent it to the client and not just to me. Trainee: Thank you, Norm. Let me take a moment to review the notes from our APS vendor to determine where the document was sent. SYM: Please do, I hope you sent it to the client. Trainee: It doesn't appear that this was sent directly to the client, instead it was sent to your office to facilitate that request. I can have that resent to you right away. SYM: Ok, that is fine. Do you really need these records though? It's been a long time. Trainee: It does look from the notes that the underwriter does require these notes in order to reach the final decision, however, I will put in a note requesting for a risk review and the underwriter will reach out with that information. In the meantime, I'll get the form over to you to reduce any further delay. SYM: That sounds fair. Thank you. Trainee: Of course. Is there anything else I can assist you with? SYM: No, that was all. Trainee: Awesome, well thank you so much for putting your trust in Northwestern Mutual. Have a great rest of your day. SYM: Thank you, you as well!",

My name is Alexis and email is cloudchaser252@gmail.com. Trainee: Thank you, Alex! How can I help you today? SYM: We just ordered a bed and a mattress. It was actually delivered last week. Mattress was fine, there's just something about the bed frame. We're kind of not - liking the color. I think we still have the return period so we would like to take advantage of it and we will buy something else. Trainee: We're sorry to hear the bed frame did not work out for you. We can take a look at your options and discuss the return process. May I have your order number, please? SYM: Yes it's 3-3-0-0-3-0. Trainee: Thank you! Please bear with me while I validate your order. Trainee: I see an order placed January 9, 2024 for a bed frame and a mattress. To confirm the item that needs to be returned, that would be Olivia Metal and Wood Platform Bed Frame in Full size, correct? SYM: Yes. That is correct. Trainee: Looking at the tracking details, it shows it was delivered January 13, 2024. I can confirm that you are still within the 30 days of your return period, Alex. Trainee: To initiate the return, the bed frame needs to be returned back to us. Ensure that the item will be returned in its original packaging - complete with all original parts including the instruction manual. Trainee: We will then send you a prepaid return label and provide instructions for arranging a FedEx pickup. Trainee: After we receive the returned item, a refund will be generated back to the original form of payment within 2-3 business days. We will email you all these details right after this call. Trainee: I hope I was able to explain the process of the return. Is there anything else I can help you with at the moment, Alex? SYM: Nope. Sounds good. I will wait for your email. Trainee: Awesome!

Thank you for calling Compassion. My name is [YOUR NAME]. How can I assist you today? SYM: Hi! I got a letter saying that my child is turning 16 today, and I thought I had to set up as an automated birthday gift. Every year he gets a birthday gift. Trainee: Thank you for being a sponsor and wanting to send a gift to your sponsored child. It's a wonderful way to show your care and support. SYM: Thank you. Do you want my account number or anything? Trainee: Yeah. May I know your sponsor number if you have it on hand? SYM: Yes, the number is X 1 Y 2 Z 3. Trainee: Thank you. Can you verify the first and last name on the account. SYM: Kim Reeves. Trainee: Alright, I have pulled up your account. And first, I would like to thank you for being part of Compassion since 2016 and for being a blessing to your two children. You do have Jim from Peru and Michael, that is from Rwanda. And with regards to the birthday gift, it looks like you haven\u2019t setup a birthday gift here on the account. The only thing that you have set up is the automatic withdrawal for your monthly sponsorship for the birthday gift. SYM: Okay. Trainee: Regrettably, we don't have it here on the account. That means you didn't send a birthday gift to your child because you don't have any automatic set up of birthday gifts. SYM: Well, I thought it was already set up. So, if you could set it up today as an automatic gift and I can make a payment today on it. You need a card? Trainee: Let me check it here on the account. You do have here a visa card ending in 5252. Is it the one that you are using? SYM: Yeah, that one's good to use. Can you put it for $40? Automated birthday gift? Trainee: Yeah. Thank you so much for that. That would be $40 annually. And since we didn't receive one for today, we will be making one time birthday gift today. And then the next one would be on November 17, 2024, right? SYM: To do one today and the one in November? Trainee: Yes. Because it takes two to three months before it will be reflected on the account or it will be given to the child. Is it only for your child in Peru or are we going to set up for the one that is from Rwanda, for a month? SYM: I thought you said that one was already on automated. Trainee: It was on the automated, but you already sent one on last May 2023. You also sent one-time payment of a one-time birthday gift, but it wasn't setup on the automated payment. SYM: Let me just wait on that right now. When is his birthday again? Trainee: Yeah, it looks like your child's birthday, Michael is in July. Do you want to set it up today? SYM: Yeah, I'll do that a little bit later. I just wanted to get this one done today because I got an email that today was his birthday. I missed it. How long is it going to take for the area there to get this for him? Trainee: Yeah, it takes two to three months before they will be receiving the gift that you have sent to them. SYM: All right. Trainee: I'll just submit it here. So that would be the $40 pretty gift or annual pretty gift into the account. SYM: All right. And you have it set up as automated now, right? Trainee: Yes, that is correct. SYM: All right, thank you. Trainee: Everything is set now. Is there anything else I could help you with? SYM: No, that's it. I appreciate it.

How about yourself? Trainee: I'm glad to hear that. I'm doing great as well. Thank you for asking. Tell me, how may I help you today? SYM: I received the SIM card the other day, and as of today, it is still not activated. Trainee: Thank you for clarifying that for me! I'd be happy to assist you with activating your new SIM card. To begin the process, I need to access your account first. I'll be asking you a few questions for security purposes; would that be fine? SYM: Sure! Trainee: Great! Can you please provide me with your billing address on file? SYM: 6000 Hollister St, Apartment 1 8 1 6, Houston, Texas 7 7 0 4 0.

How about the ICCID number of the new SIM card? SYM: Where can I find that? Trainee: The ICCID for your Xfinity Mobile SIM card can typically be found printed on the SIM card itself or on the SIM card packaging. It is a unique 20-digit number that identifies your SIM card. If you're unable to locate the ICCID on the SIM card or packaging, you can find it in the settings of your phone once it's inserted. On your iPhone, go to Settings > General > About.

This may take a few minutes to complete the process, and I'll be asking you to reset the network settings of your phone afterwards. SYM: Sure. Take your time. Trainee: Okay, here's what I found out, Danerra. Your SIM card is not activated because of the pending order on the account. And this needs to be completed before your SIM card can be activated. SYM: It's been three days; I am confused as to why my phone is still not working, and is this the only reason why? Trainee: So please give me a moment while I am working on it. I will let you know once the pending order is completed and to activate the SIM card. SYM: Sure, take your time. Trainee: All right, Danerra. I was able to activate and update your new SIM card. Kindly insert the new SIM card and reset the network settings on your phone. Before that, I would like to set your expectation that any saved Wi-Fi networks and passwords will be removed and all paired devices will be unpaired. So, after you reset the network settings, please set up your phone so everything will be connected again. Just go to Settings > General > Reset. Then select \"Reset Network Settings\" and confirm your choice when prompted. After the reset, your phone will restart. Please test the call functionality afterwards.

Are you currently booked on one of our Fun Ships or working with a Travel Advisor? SYM: No, I\u2019m calling in to see if you can help me plan my cruise. Trainee: I\u2019ll be happy to get your cruise booked today. Trainee: May I have your phone number? SYM: Sure, it is 305-222-3333. Trainee: Thank you! Trainee: What state do you live in? SYM: Florida. Trainee: Thank you. Trainee: Alice, may I have your email address? SYM: Sure! It's alice test@email.com. Trainee: Thank you! May I have your address? SYM: Sure! It's 1 2 3 Maple Street, Miami, Florida, 3 3 1 0 1. Trainee: Thank you. Trainee: Have you cruised with Carnival before? SYM: No, this is my first cruise. Trainee: Welcome to Carnival. I\u2019m so glad you chose to sail with us. Are you celebrating anything special? SYM: I\u2019m just wanting to plan a fun getaway vacation for just myself and my husband. Trainee: Fantastic! So, it sounds like you are looking for one cabin for two guests, right? SYM: Yes. Trainee: Would anyone traveling have the need for special accommodations or is pregnant? SYM: No. Trainee: And to make sure I don\u2019t miss any promotions for you, is anyone traveling an employee of an interline company such as a passenger airline, Amtrak, or UPS or FedEx? SYM: No. Trainee: Anyone serve in the U.S. Armed Forces, Canadian National Defense or over the age of 55? SYM: No, not yet. Trainee: Has your husband sailed with Carnival before? SYM: No. Trainee: And you mentioned earlier, you live in Florida, correct? SYM: Yes Trainee: What ship and sail date have you picked out? SYM: I\u2019m interested in sailing on the Carnival Breeze sailing April 1, 2027. Trainee: I\u2019m glad you are calling in to book today, that\u2019s a popular time to travel over spring break. Bear with me a moment as I pull that up. Trainee: Your cruise will be on the Breeze sailing April 1, 2027, out of the port of Galveston on a 4-day Western Caribbean itinerary. Your boarding time is from 12:30 p.m. to 2:00 p.m. and you will be visiting Cozumel, Mexico with 2 fun days at sea. SYM: Yes, that's the one we want. Trainee: Awesome! Trainee: Your ship, the Breeze, has 14 passenger decks. It has an adult serenity retreat that is only for guests 21 and older where you can sit back, relax, and smell the sea breeze. It also has a seaside theater where you can watch movies under the stars. There are some great additional food options too, like Guy\u2019s Burger Joint, which has the best burgers. SYM: My husband loves burgers. Sounds good! Trainee: Great! Trainee: Things included in your cruise are breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, ice cream, pizza, comedy shows, and our amazing stage shows. Not included are our spa treatments, alcoholic beverages, carbonated beverages, gratuities, and if you want to try your luck in our casino at sea. SYM: This sounds perfect for us. Trainee: Great! Now, let\u2019s find you the best deal for your cruise. Trainee: We have a lot of great promotions. I\u2019m seeing the best promotion for you today is our Early Saver Promotion. Trainee: The Early Saver promotion guarantees you the lowest rate from the day that you book all the way until two business days prior to your sailing. If at any time the rate drops below what you booked at, you can fill out a price protection form online and have the balance adjusted before final payment or get the difference as an onboard credit after final. Keep in mind this promotion does not allow name changes and if you cancel or move your sailing prior to final payment date it\u2019s only $50 per person fee and the rest of the money gets put towards a future cruise credit which you have 12 months to use. SYM: Okay. Trainee: What kind of cabin would you prefer? They're all very spacious. We have an interior cabin with no windows, an Ocean View with a big picture window, a Balcony cabin that gives you both a window and your own private balcony, and our largest option - a Suite, which has even more space and a balcony. SYM: We would like to have a Balcony cabin. Trainee: Great choice! That\u2019s my favorite, too. Trainee: I\u2019m looking forward to finding you a great balcony. Trainee: I found a great cabin for you. It\u2019s on our Lido Deck, Deck 10. There are only 4 cabins left that accommodate 2 guests on this deck so I\u2019m glad you called in today. This will put you in the middle of the ship. Let\u2019s look at the details about your cabin. Trainee: Your cabin has 220 square feet, two twin size beds that will convert to a king for you, and your own private balcony. One of the best things about a balcony is how you can enjoy your morning coffee or a glass of wine at night while you enjoy the sounds, smell, and view of the ocean from your own private balcony. SYM: Sounds perfect for us. Trainee: Awesome, let me get the pricing for your cabin. Trainee: Your cabin is only an average rate of $829 per person including taxes and fees based upon 2 guests in the cabin. Carnival Vacation Protection is $190 for the cabin, giving you a total of $1848.00. Trainee: All we need to get started today is a small deposit of $340, which includes activation of your Carnival Vacation Protection. The remaining balance won't be due until your final payment date of 1/16/2027. Would you like to book this with early, late or your-time dining? SYM: Let\u2019s book for a late dining. Trainee: Wonderful! Trainee: One moment while I grab your cabin. Trainee: I have the perfect cabin for you, cabin number 10277. Trainee: After this call, you will receive an email confirmation. Please read the terms and conditions of your email cruise ticket contract, as you are legally bound by the terms. SYM: Okay. Trainee: May I have each name as it appears on their travel documents? SYM: Alice Test 05/14/1985 and James Test 9/24/1984. Trainee: Thank you! Just to confirm, that was Alice Test with date of birth 05/14/1985 and you said it was your husband traveling with you, James Test, with his date of birth 9/24/1984? SYM: That is correct. Trainee: Is everyone traveling a U.S. Citizen and U.S. Resident? SYM: Yes, we are. Trainee: Thank you! Trainee: And you mentioned earlier you both live in Florida, correct? SYM: Correct. Trainee: Would you like to go ahead and include your prepaid gratuities, or will you be taking care of that onboard? SYM: I think I\u2019ll handle that onboard. Trainee: Okay, thanks! Trainee: I selected your dinner time as Late Dining as you requested earlier. SYM: Great! Trainee: Please choose a 4-digit pin number that is easy for you to remember for security purposes. SYM: How about 2 4 8 7. Trainee: 2487, got it! Trainee: And to confirm does anyone traveling have a special need or pregnant? SYM: No Trainee: And you mentioned earlier you were sailing for a fun get away. No special occasions, right? SYM: Correct, not this time. This time it is just for fun. Trainee: Thank you! Trainee: May I have your email address so we can contact you in case of itinerary changes or voyage delays?\u200b SYM: Let\u2019s use my same email earlier for me at alice test @ email.com and james test @ email.com for my husband.\u200b Trainee: Thank you! Trainee: May I have an alternate contact telephone number? SYM: Sure, my cell phone is 305-222-3333. Trainee: Thank you! Would you like a text to be sent to your mobile number for all sailing changes and payment reminders? SYM: Yes, please. Trainee: Bear with me a moment as I finish creating your booking. SYM: Okay. Trainee: I\u2019m almost done. I\u2019m just putting some additional notes on your booking. Trainee: Your booking number is X9SN55. You are sailing on the Breeze doing a 4-day Western Caribbean itinerary. We have you in that amazing balcony cabin, 10277. The total cost of your cruise is $1848 with only your deposit of $340 due today. Trainee: Are you taking care of this payment now or would you like to hear more about our partner, Flex Pay, where you could book this for as little as $0 down and pay for up to 24 months with affordable rates? SYM: I\u2019m going to use my Visa Card. Trainee: Okay, great! Trainee: May I have the name of the card holder? SYM: It\u2019s my name on the card.\u200b Alice Test. Trainee: May I have the expiration date and billing zip code? SYM: It is April 2028, and my zip code is 3 3 1 3 3. Trainee: Thank you, I have April 2028 and zip code of 33133, correct? SYM: Yes. Trainee: Would you like to pay just the deposit of $340 today? SYM: Yes, the deposit only. Trainee: As a courtesy for you, we can go ahead and set up Auto Pay for you interest free and split your final payment amount into equal amounts of $71.81 starting on May 1, 2025. Would you like to go ahead and take advantage of this? SYM: Yes, let\u2019s go ahead and set that up. Trainee: Okay, perfect. Trainee: Now that I\u2019ve verified the name of the cardholder, expiration date, zip code, and payment amount, I will be placing you into Secure Mode where I will prompt you to enter your credit card number. \u200b \u200b Trainee: During this time, you will be able to hear me, however, I will not be able to hear you. It is important that when entering your credit card number, you are not using speakerphone or a Bluetooth device. \u200b Trainee: After you input your credit card number, Secure Mode will drop, and our call will reconnect, allowing me to hear you again. Then, I can verify payment. Do you have your credit card ready? SYM: Yes. Trainee: Do you have any questions before I place you into Secure Mode?\u200b SYM: No. Trainee: You are now in Secure Mode. Please enter your credit card information. Trainee: Thank you for your payment of $340.00. Before I submit, are the last few digits 4444? SYM: Yes. Trainee: I see your payment of $340.00 has processed. Trainee: I am going to send your cabin confirmation now. Trainee: You are all set. Keep in mind that adding or removing a guest will change the average rate per person. Please refer to your confirmation that I am emailing you now or you can go on the website to carnival.com/bookedguest for your electronic documents, boarding pass, travel docs, and penalty information. SYM: Okay. Trainee: Proper travel documentation is due upon embarkation and Carnival highly recommends a passport. Trainee: Is there anything else I can help you with today? SYM: That\u2019s all. Trainee: Super! As a reminder, you will be receiving an email survey about my service today. I appreciate your feedback. SYM: Sure, you really made this whole process very easy.

        "original_transcript": "SYM: Congratulations on running your first sym. Now lets see how you did. From here you can already see your Completion Time, Keyword and Click score. SYM: Keywords are structure words in the the conversation that are good word choices or can even be compliance words that must be said. If the sym has no agent lines you will not have a keyword score. Click score is scoring where on the visual components of the sym you navigated and clicked through during the process. Click score will only be in visual syms. SYM: All of the playbacks for every sym you execute will always be in Playback on the left side of the screen, last tab, with the headphone icon. SYM: For now, Click the Green View Playback button to see more detail on how you did. SYM: Starting at the top left, you can see every attempt you have completed of this sym, and the playback for each. This allows you to see how you are improving with each attempt. SYM: You can also see if you completed it in Practice or Test Mode, the day and time completed, and you can even click re-attempt and do it again. SYM: Next you will see your Sym Accuracy Score. This measures how well your response matched the intent of what the customer was asking in the customer script line. If this is a beginner sym your score should be in the 90% range, because you would have said the script line pretty close to word for word, to learn the intent. In Intermediate and Advanced Syms, when you are formulating your own words, this score might go down, but you want to aim for the 80-90% range, so that your intent is matching the need of the customer as closely as possible. If your sym has no agent lines you will not have a sym accuracy score. SYM: Completion time is important because if it is taking you longer to navigate the conversation and screens, it can be an indication that you just need to practice the beginner sym more to learn the process better. It won't take long before you will know exactly what to do. Keep practicing. SYM: The first number in the keyword score is your score, and the second is the possible score. Keywords are structure words that are good word choices you will want to say, or they can even be compliance words you must say. Keywords guide you to the best and fastest way to customer resolution and satisfaction. SYM: The first number in the click score is your score, and the second is the possible score. Click scores are the places on the screens where you clicked, and it scored you if you clicked in the correct place. SYM: The Sym Score will equal a combined score of the different scoring options. If a sym has all three, Sym Accuracy, Keyword and Click Score, the sym score will be total of all, as one sym score. If a sym has two or only one of these scoring options, the sym score will equal the total of only the scoring options used in that sym. SYM: Text Field Keyword score will appear if the sym was created with keywords in the Text Fields that can be put into visual syms. A best practice is to always enter text into those fields exactly as directed because you never know if that text will be a keyword or not until you finish. SYM: Confidence, Concentration and Energy are your sentiment scores. These scores are calculated by the level of intent you deliver the script line in the areas of confidence, concentration and energy. These are not calculated on your voice or tone, but on how confident your level of intent is, how your focus or concentration level and how your pace or energy level of intent is. The sentiment score is calculated for the entire sym, not one part or another. SYM: The measurement for sentiment scores will be High, Medium or Low, and you can click the insights to learn more about what you did well, and what you can do to improve. SYM: As a reminder you will not receive a sentiment score in your practice attempts, only in your test attempts, and if your sym has no agent lines, you will not have a sentiment score. SYM: The playback also allows you to listen to a recording of you executing the sym. You can click a script line below and the recording will skip to that part of the recording if you wanted to only listen to a certain part. SYM: If you see a dot in the recording like this, this is the Text Field Key Word Score we just talked about. This will show you if you got that word or if you missed it. As you can see I missed it because it is red, and it gave me the correct response. SYM: The bottom part of the playback page is the actual script. The highlighted words are the keywords. If they are green I got them. If they are red I missed them. You will also notice the KS and SA and then a number score, like 3/4 and a percent, such as 86%. These are your Keyword Scores and Sym Accuracy scores by script line. The first number in the keyword score is your score and the second is the possible score. The Sym Accuracy score tells you how you did in this line with intent compared to the customer script line you were responding to. SYM: This gives you the ability to see exactly in the sym where you can improve on keywords and sym accuracy. The total Sym Accuracy and Keyword scores at the top are a total of these by script line totals. SYM: And finally you will always see the scripted line with the keywords you said or did not say vs what you said in response. The default is to show both, but you can toggle that off if you want to just see the scripted line and the keywords you said or did not say. SYM: Great Job! This concludes your simulation.",

SYM: STEP 2 - Gather Information. Trainee: Thank you, Ash. Let me pull up your policy information. While I do that, could you please provide me with the details of the medical procedure you're inquiring about? SYM: I'm considering getting a knee surgery called arthroscopic meniscectomy. I wanted to know if it's covered under my policy. Trainee: I understand. Let me check the specifics of your coverage. Just give me a moment, please. Trainee: Thank you for waiting, Ash. I have reviewed your policy, and I can confirm that arthroscopic meniscectomy is covered under your health insurance plan. However, it's important to note that coverage can vary based on factors such as medical necessity, network providers, and any applicable deductibles or co-payments. SYM: That's great to hear! Could you please provide me with some additional information? For instance, do I need a referral from my primary care physician before scheduling the surgery? Trainee: That's an excellent question, Ash. According to your policy, you do not require a referral from your primary care physician for this specific procedure. However, it's always a good idea to consult with your doctor or surgeon to ensure that the surgery is appropriate for your specific medical condition. SYM: I see. Thank you for clarifying that. Now, I'm also curious about the coverage limits and any out-of-pocket expenses I may incur. Trainee: Certainly, Ash. Let me go over that with you. Your policy has a coverage limit for surgical procedures, and I can see that it includes coverage for this specific surgery. As for out-of-pocket expenses, it's important to review your policy documents or contact our claims department to determine any deductibles, co-payments, or coinsurance that may apply. SYM: I'll make sure to review my policy documents. Lastly, could you provide me with a list of in-network surgeons or facilities that perform this procedure? Trainee: Absolutely, Ash. I can assist you with that. Please bear with me while I access the network provider information. SYM: No worries. Trainee: Thank you for your patience, Ash. I have compiled a list of in-network surgeons and facilities that perform arthroscopic meniscectomy in your area. I will email you the list to the email address we have on file.

SYM: You should not try to memorize these, as they may change for each state. SYM: Always be sure to read what's on your screen word for word. SYM: One such example is with California, the final application verbatim has an additional paragraph regarding fraud. SYM: This allows us to be compliant with California law. The fraud statement is also provided in the policy documents. SYM: Again, this is why you should not memorize verbatims. Simply follow the application. SYM: Another California law requires we obtain an email address from our California elders (which is age 65 or older) so we can send them pertinent disclosures before the application is completed. SYM: To comply with the California law, there is a verbatim early in the application regarding consent to electronic delivery and e-signature. SYM: The verbatim and email address field is mandatory, and the e-app will prevent you from continuing the application if you do not enter in a valid customer email address. SYM: Once you have entered the email address in the box you must press the Send button. If you don\u2019t press this button, the e-app will prevent you from continuing the application. SYM: If the email fails to send, the Send button will turn red and will say Fail. SYM: The e-app will prevent you from moving forward until an email has successfully been sent. SYM: If the email successfully sends, the Send button will turn green and will say Sent. SYM: Once you have received the green Sent message, you need to ask the customer to verbally confirm they received the email. SYM: This is what the email that the customer receives looks like. SYM: Here\u2019s another question that will only appear during the application in certain states. SYM: These states have state special questions and verbiage that is required to be read about accessing PDF files via the internet and providing their consent to receive electronic documents. SYM: The state requires we review this electronic consent. SYM: We're asking if they can access the internet in any shape or form. SYM: If they say no, you can clarify by asking if they have access to the internet (smart phone, library, etc.). SYM: If they still answer No, you will need to explain to the applicant that if they are not able to access the internet, or do not provide their consent, you will not be able to take their application over the phone and it will need to be mailed to them. This may delay the processing time and the effective date of their policy. SYM: Let\u2019s practice a state specific scenario! Click the arrow when you are ready to begin. Trainee: Have you received an application packet? SYM: No. Trainee: Are you able to open, view and save P D F files via the internet? SYM: No. Trainee: Do you have access to the internet by using a smart phone or going to the library? SYM: Oh, yes. I can do that. Trainee: I am required to obtain your consent for the delivery of electronic documents to you whether through the internet, email, web, text, instant message, digital media or the like. Your consent applies to all documents Mutual of Omaha may be required to deliver to you in writing. Any document provided to you electronically may be provided in paper upon your request. You may withdraw your consent at any time. If you withdraw your consent, I will not be able to complete your application over the phone and I will need to mail you a paper application. You may withdraw your consent, update your contact information or obtain a paper copy of any document for no charge, by contacting (800) 775-6000. You will need access to a computer or other device which provides internet access or email, as well as the ability to open, view and save a PDF, text or html file. Trainee: Do I have your consent to provide you with the necessary documents electronically? SYM: Yes Trainee: Disclosures are made available to you at the following website: http://www.mutualofomaha.com/wholelifedocuments SYM: Great job practicing one of those state specific items in the e App. SYM: What did we learn today? Take a moment to review some of the key learnings from this sym. SYM: Click the lightbulb when you are ready to continue.

I can have that resent to you right away. SYM: Ok, that is fine. Do you really need these records though? It's been a long time. Trainee: It does look from the notes that the underwriter does require these notes in order to reach the final decision, however, I will put in a note requesting for a risk review and the underwriter will reach out with that information.

SYM: [Phone rings] Trainee: Thank you for calling ABC Health Insurance. My name is [YOUR NAME]. How may I assist you today? SYM: Hi, my name is Ash. I wanted to inquire if a specific medical procedure is covered by my health insurance. Trainee: Of course, Ash. I'm here to help. May I have your first and last name? SYM: Ash Harris. Trainee: I appreciate it. Can you please provide me with your policy number so that I can access your account? SYM: Sure, my policy number is A B C 1 2 3 4 5 6. SYM: STEP 2 - Gather Information. Trainee: Thank you, Ash. Let me pull up your policy information. While I do that, could you please provide me with the details of the medical procedure you're inquiring about? SYM: I'm considering getting a knee surgery called arthroscopic meniscectomy. I wanted to know if it's covered under my policy. Trainee: I understand. Let me check the specifics of your coverage. Just give me a moment, please. Trainee: Thank you for waiting, Ash. I have reviewed your policy, and I can confirm that arthroscopic meniscectomy is covered under your health insurance plan. However, it's important to note that coverage can vary based on factors such as medical necessity, network providers, and any applicable deductibles or co-payments. SYM: That's great to hear! Could you please provide me with some additional information? For instance, do I need a referral from my primary care physician before scheduling the surgery? Trainee: That's an excellent question, Ash. According to your policy, you do not require a referral from your primary care physician for this specific procedure. However, it's always a good idea to consult with your doctor or surgeon to ensure that the surgery is appropriate for your specific medical condition. SYM: I see. Thank you for clarifying that. Now, I'm also curious about the coverage limits and any out-of-pocket expenses I may incur. Trainee: Certainly, Ash. Let me go over that with you. Your policy has a coverage limit for surgical procedures, and I can see that it includes coverage for this specific surgery. As for out-of-pocket expenses, it's important to review your policy documents or contact our claims department to determine any deductibles, co-payments, or coinsurance that may apply. SYM: I'll make sure to review my policy documents. Lastly, could you provide me with a list of in-network surgeons or facilities that perform this procedure? Trainee: Absolutely, Ash. I can assist you with that. Please bear with me while I access the network provider information. SYM: No worries. Trainee: Thank you for your patience, Ash. I have compiled a list of in-network surgeons and facilities that perform arthroscopic meniscectomy in your area. I will email you the list to the email address we have on file. Additionally, you can also visit our website or contact our customer service line to obtain this information. SYM: That's perfect. Thank you so much for your help. You've been very informative. SYM: STEP 3 - Closing. Trainee: You're welcome. Can you confirm your email address for me? SYM: That would be Ash@email.com Trainee: Thank you, Ash. I'm glad I could assist you. If you have any further questions or need any additional information, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. We're here to help you make the most of your health insurance coverage.

        "original_transcript": "SYM: Welcome back! Congratulations on completing your first sym a moment ago. Now let\u2019s see how you did. SYM: Before we get started, I want to draw your attention to the sym time length on the opening screen of each sym. SYM: This lets you know on average how long it should take to complete the sym. SYM: Take a moment to look for the \u201cTime Elapsed\u201d located at the top of this sym. SYM: As you work through syms, be sure to keep an eye on your pace so you can finish within the allotted time for the assignment. SYM: Let\u2019s proceed full steam ahead! SYM: Reminder, here are some best practices for navigating throughout a sym. Click the arrow when you are ready to continue. SYM: After completing a sym, you will be directed to a screen that looks like this. SYM: From here you can already see your Completion Time, Keyword Score, and Click Score. SYM: To view more details on your sym score, click View Playback. SYM: This playback view provides more insight on your performance. SYM: You can see if you completed the sym in Practice or Test Mode, the day and time completed, and you can even click re-attempt and do it again from here. SYM: Here is that completion time again. SYM: Completion time is important because if it is taking you longer to navigate the conversation and screens, it can be an indication that you just need to practice the sym more to learn the process better. SYM: Let\u2019s break down the other stats on the screen, starting with Keyword Score. SYM: Keywords are structure words in the conversation that are good word choices or can even be compliance words that must be said. If the sym has no agent lines, you will not have a keyword score. SYM: The DSC is not a scripted environment. The key words chosen throughout the syms will be ones that everyone should say. SYM: For example, everyone should state \u201cMutual of Omaha\u201d in your call introduction. SYM: The first number is your keyword score, and the second is the possible score. SYM: In that last sym, I got 3 out of 4 keywords correct. SYM: To see which one I missed, I can scroll down to find it in the playback. SYM: Words highlighted green indicate you got the keyword correct, while red indicates it was missed. SYM: Here I can see that I missed the first word, hello. SYM: You can click the Trainee Response to jump to that part of the recording, then click Play to listen. SYM: After listening to my playback, I could here that I said hello, but the microphone didn\u2019t start picking up right away so the greeting was cut off. SYM: Technology is not perfect. There could also be times where it thought you said a different word. For example, application and occupation can sound similar to a computer. SYM: That is why the training team and your supervisors review playback on lower scoring syms. SYM: This allows them to see if it was a system error or a coaching opportunity. SYM: Scroll back to the top to look at the rest of the sym score. SYM: Let\u2019s review Click Score next. SYM: Click Score is scoring where on the visual components of the sym you navigated and clicked through during the process. Click score will only be in visual syms. SYM: The first number is your click score, and the second is the possible score. SYM: In that last sym, I got 19 out of 19 clicks correct. Way to go me! That is a good indicator that I understand the process in the sym. SYM: Confidence, Concentration and Energy are your sentiment scores. SYM: These scores are calculated by the level of intent you deliver the script line in the areas of confidence, concentration and energy. SYM: These are not calculated on your voice or tone, but on how confident your level of intent is, your focus or concentration level, and your pace or energy level. SYM: The sentiment score is calculated for the entire sym, not one part or another. SYM: My Energy score was Medium. I can click Insights to view more. SYM: This is where I can find insight on how to improve that score if I were to take it again, or helpful advice for future syms. SYM: Next let\u2019s look at the Sym Accuracy Score. SYM: This measures how well your response matched the intent of what the customer was asking in the customer script line. SYM: SymTrain is still working on improvements to the Sym Accuracy score, and this is being monitored by the training team at the moment. SYM: The final stat to look at is the Sym Score. SYM: This will equal a combined score of the different scoring options for that sym. If this is a beginner sym your score should be in the 80% range. SYM: Again, technology is not perfect. That is why the training team and supervisors will take a look at those lower scores to see if it was a system error or a coaching opportunity for improvement. SYM: Now that we\u2019ve reviewed how to look at detailed playback after completing a sym, let\u2019s head to the Playback page. SYM: The Playback page provides an overview of your sym performance for all your completed syms. SYM: To view the detailed playback for any sym, simply click the Actions icon. SYM: This concludes the simulation. SYM: What did we learn today? Take a moment to review some of the key learnings from this sym. SYM: Click the lightbulb when you are ready to continue. SYM: Fantastic job completing SymTrain 1 0 1! You are ready to continue your learning journey and start taking syms! Bon voyage!",

So, you told me it was with cash, do you remember how much was the total amount of the receipt? SYM: The car seat stroller combo was around $199.

Just give me a few moments here. SYM: Okay. Trainee: I see that for your monthly payment plan, you were set up using your American Express card ending in 5500 and I see that it's about to expire. So, expiration date is December of 2023. SYM: Correct. Trainee: So, you'll be setting up for a new card or a totally different card? SYM: Yes. It's a new American Express card with a different card number. Trainee: Okay, so let's start to set up your new card information. SYM: Okay. Trainee: To setup your new card and also for the safety of it, I'll be transferring you to our secure line where all you have to do is just simply enter the card number over the phone, and again this call will be routed back to me. Would that be, okay? SYM: Sure. Thanks. Trainee: So, I'll be transferring you now. SYM: Sure! SYM: [Customer enters the new card number over the phone.] Trainee: Yes, thank you so much. I do have now your American Express card ending in 2005. And can you please confirm the card's expiration date? SYM: It is eight of 28. Trainee: And how does your name appear on this card? SYM: Lisa J Turner. Trainee: Thank you. So, let me set up your new card information for your automatic monthly payment plan. Give me a few moments here. SYM: Sure. I believe they have already drafted out for this month, correct? Trainee: Yes, that is correct. It was drafted on December 19. SYM: Okay. Trainee: Thank you so much for patiently waiting, Miss Turner. I have set up your new card information for your automatic monthly payment which would be starting from next month. The date is set for every 19th day of each month. SYM: Perfect! Trainee: Thank you for your time calling us. And was there anything else that I can help you for today? SYM: No, that's it. I appreciate that and thank you. Trainee: You're welcome, Miss Turner. You have a great day! SYM: You as well. Bye! SYM: This concludes your simulation.",

SYM: Concentrate on each slide detail to WIN the quiz at the end. SYM: There are several types of learning, categorized based on theories, approaches, and settings. Here\u2019s an overview SYM: Visual learners understand best through pictures, charts, and diagrams. They prefer shapes and patterns over words or speech. Teachers can help by using tools like graphic organizers to explain ideas clearly. SYM: Auditory learners learn best by hearing and speaking. They enjoy lectures, group discussions, and talking through ideas. They often figure things out by speaking first, rather than planning what to say. SYM: Reading & writing learners understand best through words. They enjoy reading and do well with written tasks like stories or reports. They prefer learning through text, such as reading books or writing notes. Teachers can help by asking them to explain diagrams or charts in writing, which they can review later to remember the information. SYM: Kinesthetic learners learn best by doing. They like hands-on activities, real-life examples, and practicing skills through physical actions. Teachers can help by giving them practical tasks, like recreating experiments or working through examples to understand new ideas.

SYM: [Phone rings] Trainee: Thank you for calling ABC Health Insurance. My name is [YOUR NAME]. How may I assist you today? SYM: Hi, my name is Ash. I wanted to inquire if a specific medical procedure is covered by my health insurance. Trainee: Of course, Ash. I'm here to help. May I have your first and last name? SYM: Ash Harris. Trainee: I appreciate it. Can you please provide me with your policy number so that I can access your account? SYM: Sure, my policy number is A B C 1 2 3 4 5 6. SYM: STEP 2 - Gather Information. Trainee: Thank you, Ash. Let me pull up your policy information. While I do that, could you please provide me with the details of the medical procedure you're inquiring about? SYM: I'm considering getting a knee surgery called arthroscopic meniscectomy. I wanted to know if it's covered under my policy. Trainee: I understand. Let me check the specifics of your coverage. Just give me a moment, please. Trainee: Thank you for waiting, Ash. I have reviewed your policy, and I can confirm that arthroscopic meniscectomy is covered under your health insurance plan. However, it's important to note that coverage can vary based on factors such as medical necessity, network providers, and any applicable deductibles or co-payments. SYM: That's great to hear! Could you please provide me with some additional information? For instance, do I need a referral from my primary care physician before scheduling the surgery? Trainee: That's an excellent question, Ash. According to your policy, you do not require a referral from your primary care physician for this specific procedure. However, it's always a good idea to consult with your doctor or surgeon to ensure that the surgery is appropriate for your specific medical condition. SYM: I see. Thank you for clarifying that. Now, I'm also curious about the coverage limits and any out-of-pocket expenses I may incur. Trainee: Certainly, Ash. Let me go over that with you. Your policy has a coverage limit for surgical procedures, and I can see that it includes coverage for this specific surgery. As for out-of-pocket expenses, it's important to review your policy documents or contact our claims department to determine any deductibles, co-payments, or coinsurance that may apply. SYM: I'll make sure to review my policy documents. Lastly, could you provide me with a list of in-network surgeons or facilities that perform this procedure? Trainee: Absolutely, Ash. I can assist you with that. Please bear with me while I access the network provider information. SYM: No worries. Trainee: Thank you for your patience, Ash. I have compiled a list of in-network surgeons and facilities that perform arthroscopic meniscectomy in your area. I will email you the list to the email address we have on file. Additionally, you can also visit our website or contact our customer service line to obtain this information. SYM: That's perfect. Thank you so much for your help. You've been very informative. SYM: STEP 3 - Closing. Trainee: You're welcome. Can you confirm your email address for me? SYM: That would be Ash@email.com Trainee: Thank you, Ash. I'm glad I could assist you. If you have any further questions or need any additional information, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. We're here to help you make the most of your health insurance coverage.

SYM: Let\u2019s start by reviewing some tips for how to navigate throughout a Sym. SYM: When you see a box outlined in blue, that is something in the sym you need to click in order to continue. SYM: A green box indicates a text field. You will need to type a response in the box. Use your mouse to click inside the box, type the required text, then press enter on your keyboard while still in the text box to submit your response. SYM: Let\u2019s practice! Type your favorite color in the box that appears. SYM: Thanks for sharing! SYM: The final interaction portion you will encounter in syms is speaking. SYM: If a sym requires a verbal response, a microphone will appear. Say your answer out loud, then click the next button to continue. SYM: Let\u2019s practice! When the microphone icon appears, read the dialogue that appears in the bottom of your screen, then click next. Trainee: Hello, my name is (your first name). SYM: Great job! SYM: Let\u2019s continue with how to navigate SymTrain. SYM: Your SymTrain Home page will show your Overall Stats on the syms you have completed. SYM: You are also able to make Accessibility Adjustments. SYM: Here are some of the options available. After this sym, feel free to check out how the different settings work and toggle on any settings that are beneficial to you. SYM: SymTrain also has a built in Support feature if you need help at any time. SYM: You have the option to message SymTrain for support, provide feedback, or use the SymTrain AI_Help for self-troubleshooting. SYM: Since you are taking this sym, you have obviously learned how to launch a sym \u2013 way to go! SYM: However, you might not have realized there is more than one way to launch a sym. SYM: The first is click the play icon next to any of the syms shown on your Home page. SYM: The second is from your My Exercises tab, let\u2019s head there now. SYM: Here is where you will find all syms that have been assigned to you as well as your progress. SYM: As you continue your journey in the DSC, you may have more than 10 rows of assignments and will need to expand your rows per page or view the other pages to find assignments. SYM: If you see a stacked icon, that indicates that is a sym module, which means it contains more than one sym. Click the icon to expand and see the included syms. SYM: On the right, you can see what syms you have already completed in that module. SYM: To launch a sym from your exercises, you can click on the play icon on the left of the sym or module. SYM: Or you can click on an individual sym from the module list to launch that sym. Let\u2019s practice that. SYM: As you already saw, you can select if you would like to proceed with completing a Practice or Test version of the sym. SYM: You can also select a different sym to launch from the module list by clicking the play icon on the sym tile. SYM: Some syms, like the one you are taking right now, require verbal responses. It is important to make sure the correct microphone setting is selected so SymTrain can hear you and record your response. SYM: Before starting your first sym of the day, you should check your hardware. SYM: Using your company provided headset is the best practice to ensure that SymTrain can pick up your voice clearly. To use the headset while in a sym, make sure it is plugged into your laptop and not your phone. SYM: While you can select your laptop\u2019s built in microphone as an option, depending on your desk setup that microphone might be too far away to pick up your voice clearly. SYM: Let\u2019s practice what this would look like. SYM: For the purposes of this sym, we will give you a prompt to speak into the microphone. SYM: When you a ready, click Start Recording for a prompt to appear at the bottom of the screen. SYM: Say the prompt out loud, then click the Next icon that appears to continue. Trainee: Mic check. Test one, two, three. SYM: Great job! After recording, there will be a playback button that will allow you to hear how you sound to ensure quality recording throughout any sym that day. SYM: That was just a simulated practice. Be sure to check this feature out for real before your next sym. SYM: The final area to explore is the Playback. We will review that next sym. SYM: What did we learn today? Take a moment to review some of the key learnings from this sym. SYM: Click the lightbulb when you are ready to continue. SYM: Fantastic job completing your first sym! Let\u2019s stay on track and head over to the next one where we learn how to view your sym playback.",

SYM: STEP 2 - Gather Information. Trainee: Thank you, Ash. Let me pull up your policy information. While I do that, could you please provide me with the details of the medical procedure you're inquiring about? SYM: I'm considering getting a knee surgery called arthroscopic meniscectomy. I wanted to know if it's covered under my policy. Trainee: I understand. Let me check the specifics of your coverage. Just give me a moment, please. Trainee: Thank you for waiting, Ash. I have reviewed your policy, and I can confirm that arthroscopic meniscectomy is covered under your health insurance plan. However, it's important to note that coverage can vary based on factors such as medical necessity, network providers, and any applicable deductibles or co-payments. SYM: That's great to hear! Could you please provide me with some additional information? For instance, do I need a referral from my primary care physician before scheduling the surgery? Trainee: That's an excellent question, Ash. According to your policy, you do not require a referral from your primary care physician for this specific procedure. However, it's always a good idea to consult with your doctor or surgeon to ensure that the surgery is appropriate for your specific medical condition. SYM: I see. Thank you for clarifying that. Now, I'm also curious about the coverage limits and any out-of-pocket expenses I may incur. Trainee: Certainly, Ash. Let me go over that with you. Your policy has a coverage limit for surgical procedures, and I can see that it includes coverage for this specific surgery. As for out-of-pocket expenses, it's important to review your policy documents or contact our claims department to determine any deductibles, co-payments, or coinsurance that may apply. SYM: I'll make sure to review my policy documents. Lastly, could you provide me with a list of in-network surgeons or facilities that perform this procedure? Trainee: Absolutely, Ash. I can assist you with that. Please bear with me while I access the network provider information. SYM: No worries. Trainee: Thank you for your patience, Ash. I have compiled a list of in-network surgeons and facilities that perform arthroscopic meniscectomy in your area. I will email you the list to the email address we have on file.

Trainee: Since you'll be sailing on the Carnival Horizon, the tour starts at $130. It runs about 3 to 3\u00be hours and gives you an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the ship. You\u2019ll get to see the bridge, the engine control room, the main galley, staff dining areas, storerooms, the laundry, and more. It\u2019s a rare chance to explore parts of the ship most guests never get to see. SYM: Awesome I will go on Carnival.com and book that. Trainee: That's great, each tour is limited to 16 people so booking in advance is recommended. Trainee: Mary, do you have any other questions for me today? SYM: No, that is all I had for you today. Trainee: It\u2019s been my pleasure to assist you, Mary. Would you mind if I sent you a survey about my service today? SYM: Yes, you can do that.

Trainee: So, may I have then your updated address, please? SYM: No, I don't need to. It sounds like it has been updated. Trainee: Great! So, let's proceed with updating of your payment information. Just give me a few moments here. SYM: Okay. Trainee: I see that for your monthly payment plan, you were set up using your American Express card ending in 5500 and I see that it's about to expire. So, expiration date is December of 2023. SYM: Correct. Trainee: So, you'll be setting up for a new card or a totally different card? SYM: Yes. It's a new American Express card with a different card number. Trainee: Okay, so let's start to set up your new card information. SYM: Okay. Trainee: To setup your new card and also for the safety of it, I'll be transferring you to our secure line where all you have to do is just simply enter the card number over the phone, and again this call will be routed back to me. Would that be, okay? SYM: Sure. Thanks. Trainee: So, I'll be transferring you now. SYM: Sure! SYM: [Customer enters the new card number over the phone.] Trainee: Yes, thank you so much. I do have now your American Express card ending in 2005. And can you please confirm the card's expiration date? SYM: It is eight of 28. Trainee: And how does your name appear on this card? SYM: Lisa J Turner. Trainee: Thank you. So, let me set up your new card information for your automatic monthly payment plan. Give me a few moments here. SYM: Sure. I believe they have already drafted out for this month, correct? Trainee: Yes, that is correct. It was drafted on December 19. SYM: Okay. Trainee: Thank you so much for patiently waiting, Miss Turner. I have set up your new card information for your automatic monthly payment which would be starting from next month. The date is set for every 19th day of each month. SYM: Perfect! Trainee: Thank you for your time calling us. And was there anything else that I can help you for today? SYM: No, that's it. I appreciate that and thank you. Trainee: You're welcome, Miss Turner. You have a great day! SYM: You as well. Bye! SYM: This concludes your simulation.",

SYM: [Phone rings] Trainee: Thank you for calling ABC Health Insurance. My name is [YOUR NAME]. How may I assist you today? SYM: Hi, my name is Ash. I wanted to inquire if a specific medical procedure is covered by my health insurance. Trainee: Of course, Ash. I'm here to help. May I have your first and last name? SYM: Ash Harris. Trainee: I appreciate it. Can you please provide me with your policy number so that I can access your account? SYM: Sure, my policy number is A B C 1 2 3 4 5 6. SYM: STEP 2 - Gather Information. Trainee: Thank you, Ash. Let me pull up your policy information. While I do that, could you please provide me with the details of the medical procedure you're inquiring about? SYM: I'm considering getting a knee surgery called arthroscopic meniscectomy. I wanted to know if it's covered under my policy. Trainee: I understand. Let me check the specifics of your coverage. Just give me a moment, please. Trainee: Thank you for waiting, Ash. I have reviewed your policy, and I can confirm that arthroscopic meniscectomy is covered under your health insurance plan. However, it's important to note that coverage can vary based on factors such as medical necessity, network providers, and any applicable deductibles or co-payments. SYM: That's great to hear! Could you please provide me with some additional information? For instance, do I need a referral from my primary care physician before scheduling the surgery? Trainee: That's an excellent question, Ash. According to your policy, you do not require a referral from your primary care physician for this specific procedure. However, it's always a good idea to consult with your doctor or surgeon to ensure that the surgery is appropriate for your specific medical condition. SYM: I see. Thank you for clarifying that. Now, I'm also curious about the coverage limits and any out-of-pocket expenses I may incur. Trainee: Certainly, Ash. Let me go over that with you. Your policy has a coverage limit for surgical procedures, and I can see that it includes coverage for this specific surgery. As for out-of-pocket expenses, it's important to review your policy documents or contact our claims department to determine any deductibles, co-payments, or coinsurance that may apply. SYM: I'll make sure to review my policy documents. Lastly, could you provide me with a list of in-network surgeons or facilities that perform this procedure? Trainee: Absolutely, Ash. I can assist you with that. Please bear with me while I access the network provider information. SYM: No worries. Trainee: Thank you for your patience, Ash. I have compiled a list of in-network surgeons and facilities that perform arthroscopic meniscectomy in your area. I will email you the list to the email address we have on file. Additionally, you can also visit our website or contact our customer service line to obtain this information. SYM: That's perfect. Thank you so much for your help. You've been very informative. SYM: STEP 3 - Closing. Trainee: You're welcome. Can you confirm your email address for me? SYM: That would be Ash@email.com Trainee: Thank you, Ash. I'm glad I could assist you. If you have any further questions or need any additional information, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. We're here to help you make the most of your health insurance coverage.

        "original_transcript": "SYM: Welcome back! Congratulations on completing your first sym a moment ago. Now let\u2019s see how you did. SYM: Before we get started, I want to draw your attention to the sym time length on the opening screen of each sym. SYM: This lets you know on average how long it should take to complete the sym. SYM: Take a moment to look for the \u201cTime Elapsed\u201d located at the top of this sym. SYM: As you work through syms, be sure to keep an eye on your pace so you can finish within the allotted time for the assignment. SYM: Let\u2019s proceed full steam ahead! SYM: Reminder, here are some best practices for navigating throughout a sym. Click the arrow when you are ready to continue. SYM: After completing a sym, you will be directed to a screen that looks like this. SYM: From here you can already see your Completion Time, Keyword Score, and Click Score. SYM: To view more details on your sym score, click View Playback. SYM: This playback view provides more insight on your performance. SYM: You can see if you completed the sym in Practice or Test Mode, the day and time completed, and you can even click re-attempt and do it again from here. SYM: Here is that completion time again. SYM: Completion time is important because if it is taking you longer to navigate the conversation and screens, it can be an indication that you just need to practice the sym more to learn the process better. SYM: Let\u2019s break down the other stats on the screen, starting with Keyword Score. SYM: Keywords are structure words in the conversation that are good word choices or can even be compliance words that must be said. If the sym has no agent lines, you will not have a keyword score. SYM: The DSC is not a scripted environment. The key words chosen throughout the syms will be ones that everyone should say. SYM: For example, everyone should state \u201cMutual of Omaha\u201d in your call introduction. SYM: The first number is your keyword score, and the second is the possible score. SYM: In that last sym, I got 3 out of 4 keywords correct. SYM: To see which one I missed, I can scroll down to find it in the playback. SYM: Words highlighted green indicate you got the keyword correct, while red indicates it was missed. SYM: Here I can see that I missed the first word, hello. SYM: You can click the Trainee Response to jump to that part of the recording, then click Play to listen. SYM: After listening to my playback, I could here that I said hello, but the microphone didn\u2019t start picking up right away so the greeting was cut off. SYM: Technology is not perfect. There could also be times where it thought you said a different word. For example, application and occupation can sound similar to a computer. SYM: That is why the training team and your supervisors review playback on lower scoring syms. SYM: This allows them to see if it was a system error or a coaching opportunity. SYM: Scroll back to the top to look at the rest of the sym score. SYM: Let\u2019s review Click Score next. SYM: Click Score is scoring where on the visual components of the sym you navigated and clicked through during the process. Click score will only be in visual syms. SYM: The first number is your click score, and the second is the possible score. SYM: In that last sym, I got 19 out of 19 clicks correct. Way to go me! That is a good indicator that I understand the process in the sym. SYM: Confidence, Concentration and Energy are your sentiment scores. SYM: These scores are calculated by the level of intent you deliver the script line in the areas of confidence, concentration and energy. SYM: These are not calculated on your voice or tone, but on how confident your level of intent is, your focus or concentration level, and your pace or energy level. SYM: The sentiment score is calculated for the entire sym, not one part or another. SYM: My Energy score was Medium. I can click Insights to view more. SYM: This is where I can find insight on how to improve that score if I were to take it again, or helpful advice for future syms. SYM: Next let\u2019s look at the Sym Accuracy Score. SYM: This measures how well your response matched the intent of what the customer was asking in the customer script line. SYM: SymTrain is still working on improvements to the Sym Accuracy score, and this is being monitored by the training team at the moment. SYM: The final stat to look at is the Sym Score. SYM: This will equal a combined score of the different scoring options for that sym. If this is a beginner sym your score should be in the 80% range. SYM: Again, technology is not perfect. That is why the training team and supervisors will take a look at those lower scores to see if it was a system error or a coaching opportunity for improvement. SYM: Now that we\u2019ve reviewed how to look at detailed playback after completing a sym, let\u2019s head to the Playback page. SYM: The Playback page provides an overview of your sym performance for all your completed syms. SYM: To view the detailed playback for any sym, simply click the Actions icon. SYM: This concludes the simulation. SYM: What did we learn today? Take a moment to review some of the key learnings from this sym. SYM: Click the lightbulb when you are ready to continue. SYM: Fantastic job completing SymTrain 1 0 1! You are ready to continue your learning journey and start taking syms! Bon voyage!",

SYM: [Phone rings] Trainee: Thank you for calling ABC Health Insurance. My name is [YOUR NAME]. How may I assist you today? SYM: Hi, my name is Ash. I wanted to inquire if a specific medical procedure is covered by my health insurance. Trainee: Of course, Ash. I'm here to help. May I have your first and last name? SYM: Ash Harris. Trainee: I appreciate it. Can you please provide me with your policy number so that I can access your account? SYM: Sure, my policy number is A B C 1 2 3 4 5 6. SYM: STEP 2 - Gather Information. Trainee: Thank you, Ash. Let me pull up your policy information. While I do that, could you please provide me with the details of the medical procedure you're inquiring about? SYM: I'm considering getting a knee surgery called arthroscopic meniscectomy. I wanted to know if it's covered under my policy. Trainee: I understand. Let me check the specifics of your coverage. Just give me a moment, please. Trainee: Thank you for waiting, Ash. I have reviewed your policy, and I can confirm that arthroscopic meniscectomy is covered under your health insurance plan. However, it's important to note that coverage can vary based on factors such as medical necessity, network providers, and any applicable deductibles or co-payments. SYM: That's great to hear! Could you please provide me with some additional information? For instance, do I need a referral from my primary care physician before scheduling the surgery? Trainee: That's an excellent question, Ash. According to your policy, you do not require a referral from your primary care physician for this specific procedure. However, it's always a good idea to consult with your doctor or surgeon to ensure that the surgery is appropriate for your specific medical condition. SYM: I see. Thank you for clarifying that. Now, I'm also curious about the coverage limits and any out-of-pocket expenses I may incur. Trainee: Certainly, Ash. Let me go over that with you. Your policy has a coverage limit for surgical procedures, and I can see that it includes coverage for this specific surgery. As for out-of-pocket expenses, it's important to review your policy documents or contact our claims department to determine any deductibles, co-payments, or coinsurance that may apply. SYM: I'll make sure to review my policy documents. Lastly, could you provide me with a list of in-network surgeons or facilities that perform this procedure? Trainee: Absolutely, Ash. I can assist you with that. Please bear with me while I access the network provider information. SYM: No worries. Trainee: Thank you for your patience, Ash. I have compiled a list of in-network surgeons and facilities that perform arthroscopic meniscectomy in your area. I will email you the list to the email address we have on file. Additionally, you can also visit our website or contact our customer service line to obtain this information. SYM: That's perfect. Thank you so much for your help. You've been very informative. SYM: STEP 3 - Closing. Trainee: You're welcome. Can you confirm your email address for me? SYM: That would be Ash@email.com Trainee: Thank you, Ash. I'm glad I could assist you. If you have any further questions or need any additional information, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. We're here to help you make the most of your health insurance coverage.

SYM: Let\u2019s start by reviewing some tips for how to navigate throughout a Sym. SYM: When you see a box outlined in blue, that is something in the sym you need to click in order to continue. SYM: A green box indicates a text field. You will need to type a response in the box. Use your mouse to click inside the box, type the required text, then press enter on your keyboard while still in the text box to submit your response. SYM: Let\u2019s practice! Type your favorite color in the box that appears. SYM: Thanks for sharing! SYM: The final interaction portion you will encounter in syms is speaking. SYM: If a sym requires a verbal response, a microphone will appear. Say your answer out loud, then click the next button to continue. SYM: Let\u2019s practice! When the microphone icon appears, read the dialogue that appears in the bottom of your screen, then click next. Trainee: Hello, my name is (your first name). SYM: Great job! SYM: Let\u2019s continue with how to navigate SymTrain. SYM: Your SymTrain Home page will show your Overall Stats on the syms you have completed. SYM: You are also able to make Accessibility Adjustments. SYM: Here are some of the options available. After this sym, feel free to check out how the different settings work and toggle on any settings that are beneficial to you. SYM: SymTrain also has a built in Support feature if you need help at any time. SYM: You have the option to message SymTrain for support, provide feedback, or use the SymTrain AI_Help for self-troubleshooting. SYM: Since you are taking this sym, you have obviously learned how to launch a sym \u2013 way to go! SYM: However, you might not have realized there is more than one way to launch a sym. SYM: The first is click the play icon next to any of the syms shown on your Home page. SYM: The second is from your My Exercises tab, let\u2019s head there now. SYM: Here is where you will find all syms that have been assigned to you as well as your progress. SYM: As you continue your journey in the DSC, you may have more than 10 rows of assignments and will need to expand your rows per page or view the other pages to find assignments. SYM: If you see a stacked icon, that indicates that is a sym module, which means it contains more than one sym. Click the icon to expand and see the included syms. SYM: On the right, you can see what syms you have already completed in that module. SYM: To launch a sym from your exercises, you can click on the play icon on the left of the sym or module. SYM: Or you can click on an individual sym from the module list to launch that sym. Let\u2019s practice that. SYM: As you already saw, you can select if you would like to proceed with completing a Practice or Test version of the sym. SYM: You can also select a different sym to launch from the module list by clicking the play icon on the sym tile. SYM: Some syms, like the one you are taking right now, require verbal responses. It is important to make sure the correct microphone setting is selected so SymTrain can hear you and record your response. SYM: Before starting your first sym of the day, you should check your hardware. SYM: Using your company provided headset is the best practice to ensure that SymTrain can pick up your voice clearly. To use the headset while in a sym, make sure it is plugged into your laptop and not your phone. SYM: While you can select your laptop\u2019s built in microphone as an option, depending on your desk setup that microphone might be too far away to pick up your voice clearly. SYM: Let\u2019s practice what this would look like. SYM: For the purposes of this sym, we will give you a prompt to speak into the microphone. SYM: When you a ready, click Start Recording for a prompt to appear at the bottom of the screen. SYM: Say the prompt out loud, then click the Next icon that appears to continue. Trainee: Mic check. Test one, two, three. SYM: Great job! After recording, there will be a playback button that will allow you to hear how you sound to ensure quality recording throughout any sym that day. SYM: That was just a simulated practice. Be sure to check this feature out for real before your next sym. SYM: The final area to explore is the Playback. We will review that next sym. SYM: What did we learn today? Take a moment to review some of the key learnings from this sym. SYM: Click the lightbulb when you are ready to continue. SYM: Fantastic job completing your first sym! Let\u2019s stay on track and head over to the next one where we learn how to view your sym playback.",

Follow the instructions provided throughout the simulation and complete the sym. SYM: This is the Hotspot. You would need to click on it to type in the answer or you would need to click on it to move to the next step. After typing in the details, you would need to click the 'enter' key to move forward. SYM: Concentrate on each slide detail to WIN the quiz at the end. SYM: There are several types of learning, categorized based on theories, approaches, and settings. Here\u2019s an overview SYM: Visual learners understand best through pictures, charts, and diagrams. They prefer shapes and patterns over words or speech. Teachers can help by using tools like graphic organizers to explain ideas clearly. SYM: Auditory learners learn best by hearing and speaking. They enjoy lectures, group discussions, and talking through ideas. They often figure things out by speaking first, rather than planning what to say. SYM: Reading & writing learners understand best through words. They enjoy reading and do well with written tasks like stories or reports. They prefer learning through text, such as reading books or writing notes. Teachers can help by asking them to explain diagrams or charts in writing, which they can review later to remember the information. SYM: Kinesthetic learners learn best by doing. They like hands-on activities, real-life examples, and practicing skills through physical actions.

SYM: Please do, I hope you sent it to the client. Trainee: It doesn't appear that this was sent directly to the client, instead it was sent to your office to facilitate that request. I can have that resent to you right away. SYM: Ok, that is fine. Do you really need these records though? It's been a long time. Trainee: It does look from the notes that the underwriter does require these notes in order to reach the final decision, however, I will put in a note requesting for a risk review and the underwriter will reach out with that information. In the meantime, I'll get the form over to you to reduce any further delay. SYM: That sounds fair. Thank you. Trainee: Of course. Is there anything else I can assist you with? SYM: No, that was all.

I\u2019m so glad you chose to sail with us. Are you celebrating anything special? SYM: I\u2019m just wanting to plan a fun getaway vacation for just myself and my husband. Trainee: Fantastic! So, it sounds like you are looking for one cabin for two guests, right? SYM: Yes. Trainee: Would anyone traveling have the need for special accommodations or is pregnant? SYM: No. Trainee: And to make sure I don\u2019t miss any promotions for you, is anyone traveling an employee of an interline company such as a passenger airline, Amtrak, or UPS or FedEx? SYM: No. Trainee: Anyone serve in the U.S. Armed Forces, Canadian National Defense or over the age of 55? SYM: No, not yet. Trainee: Has your husband sailed with Carnival before? SYM: No. Trainee: And you mentioned earlier, you live in Florida, correct? SYM: Yes Trainee: What ship and sail date have you picked out? SYM: I\u2019m interested in sailing on the Carnival Breeze sailing April 1, 2027. Trainee: I\u2019m glad you are calling in to book today, that\u2019s a popular time to travel over spring break. Bear with me a moment as I pull that up. Trainee: Your cruise will be on the Breeze sailing April 1, 2027, out of the port of Galveston on a 4-day Western Caribbean itinerary. Your boarding time is from 12:30 p.m. to 2:00 p.m. and you will be visiting Cozumel, Mexico with 2 fun days at sea. SYM: Yes, that's the one we want. Trainee: Awesome! Trainee: Your ship, the Breeze, has 14 passenger decks. It has an adult serenity retreat that is only for guests 21 and older where you can sit back, relax, and smell the sea breeze. It also has a seaside theater where you can watch movies under the stars. There are some great additional food options too, like Guy\u2019s Burger Joint, which has the best burgers. SYM: My husband loves burgers. Sounds good! Trainee: Great! Trainee: Things included in your cruise are breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, ice cream, pizza, comedy shows, and our amazing stage shows. Not included are our spa treatments, alcoholic beverages, carbonated beverages, gratuities, and if you want to try your luck in our casino at sea. SYM: This sounds perfect for us. Trainee: Great! Now, let\u2019s find you the best deal for your cruise. Trainee: We have a lot of great promotions. I\u2019m seeing the best promotion for you today is our Early Saver Promotion. Trainee: The Early Saver promotion guarantees you the lowest rate from the day that you book all the way until two business days prior to your sailing. If at any time the rate drops below what you booked at, you can fill out a price protection form online and have the balance adjusted before final payment or get the difference as an onboard credit after final. Keep in mind this promotion does not allow name changes and if you cancel or move your sailing prior to final payment date it\u2019s only $50 per person fee and the rest of the money gets put towards a future cruise credit which you have 12 months to use. SYM: Okay. Trainee: What kind of cabin would you prefer? They're all very spacious. We have an interior cabin with no windows, an Ocean View with a big picture window, a Balcony cabin that gives you both a window and your own private balcony, and our largest option - a Suite, which has even more space and a balcony. SYM: We would like to have a Balcony cabin. Trainee: Great choice! That\u2019s my favorite, too. Trainee: I\u2019m looking forward to finding you a great balcony. Trainee: I found a great cabin for you. It\u2019s on our Lido Deck, Deck 10. There are only 4 cabins left that accommodate 2 guests on this deck so I\u2019m glad you called in today. This will put you in the middle of the ship. Let\u2019s look at the details about your cabin. Trainee: Your cabin has 220 square feet, two twin size beds that will convert to a king for you, and your own private balcony. One of the best things about a balcony is how you can enjoy your morning coffee or a glass of wine at night while you enjoy the sounds, smell, and view of the ocean from your own private balcony. SYM: Sounds perfect for us. Trainee: Awesome, let me get the pricing for your cabin. Trainee: Your cabin is only an average rate of $829 per person including taxes and fees based upon 2 guests in the cabin. Carnival Vacation Protection is $190 for the cabin, giving you a total of $1848.00. Trainee: All we need to get started today is a small deposit of $340, which includes activation of your Carnival Vacation Protection. The remaining balance won't be due until your final payment date of 1/16/2027. Would you like to book this with early, late or your-time dining? SYM: Let\u2019s book for a late dining. Trainee: Wonderful! Trainee: One moment while I grab your cabin. Trainee: I have the perfect cabin for you, cabin number 10277. Trainee: After this call, you will receive an email confirmation. Please read the terms and conditions of your email cruise ticket contract, as you are legally bound by the terms. SYM: Okay. Trainee: May I have each name as it appears on their travel documents? SYM: Alice Test 05/14/1985 and James Test 9/24/1984. Trainee: Thank you! Just to confirm, that was Alice Test with date of birth 05/14/1985 and you said it was your husband traveling with you, James Test, with his date of birth 9/24/1984? SYM: That is correct. Trainee: Is everyone traveling a U.S. Citizen and U.S. Resident? SYM: Yes, we are. Trainee: Thank you! Trainee: And you mentioned earlier you both live in Florida, correct? SYM: Correct.

SYM: Reminder that we can not C O P whole life applications for Connecticut or Montana. SYM: New York has its own application for our Guaranteed Whole Life policy. We\u2019ll go into detail on New York later. SYM: The states in red on the map have some different verbatim messages that will appear in the e App. SYM: Remember that these boxes are verbatim statements. SYM: You should not try to memorize these, as they may change for each state. SYM: Always be sure to read what's on your screen word for word. SYM: One such example is with California, the final application verbatim has an additional paragraph regarding fraud. SYM: This allows us to be compliant with California law. The fraud statement is also provided in the policy documents. SYM: Again, this is why you should not memorize verbatims. Simply follow the application. SYM: Another California law requires we obtain an email address from our California elders (which is age 65 or older) so we can send them pertinent disclosures before the application is completed. SYM: To comply with the California law, there is a verbatim early in the application regarding consent to electronic delivery and e-signature. SYM: The verbatim and email address field is mandatory, and the e-app will prevent you from continuing the application if you do not enter in a valid customer email address. SYM: Once you have entered the email address in the box you must press the Send button. If you don\u2019t press this button, the e-app will prevent you from continuing the application. SYM: If the email fails to send, the Send button will turn red and will say Fail. SYM: The e-app will prevent you from moving forward until an email has successfully been sent. SYM: If the email successfully sends, the Send button will turn green and will say Sent. SYM: Once you have received the green Sent message, you need to ask the customer to verbally confirm they received the email. SYM: This is what the email that the customer receives looks like. SYM: Here\u2019s another question that will only appear during the application in certain states. SYM: These states have state special questions and verbiage that is required to be read about accessing PDF files via the internet and providing their consent to receive electronic documents. SYM: The state requires we review this electronic consent. SYM: We're asking if they can access the internet in any shape or form. SYM: If they say no, you can clarify by asking if they have access to the internet (smart phone, library, etc.). SYM: If they still answer No, you will need to explain to the applicant that if they are not able to access the internet, or do not provide their consent, you will not be able to take their application over the phone and it will need to be mailed to them. This may delay the processing time and the effective date of their policy. SYM: Let\u2019s practice a state specific scenario! Click the arrow when you are ready to begin. Trainee: Have you received an application packet? SYM: No. Trainee: Are you able to open, view and save P D F files via the internet?

If you are starting this sym, that means you chose the Empathy Close as the technique you would like to try on your calls. \u200b If you wanted to try a different closing technique, now is the time to exit this sym and head to the one you wanted to practice. SYM: Here are a few tips for how to navigate throughout this Sym. Click the arrow when you\u2019re ready to continue.\u200b SYM: As reviewed earlier, the Empathy Close technique focuses on the customer\u2019s perspective and feelings and leaning into those emotions to show how the product will help them.\u200b SYM: Here\u2019s an example of how an empathy close might sound.\u200b SYM: I know you\u2019re concerned about having this in place for your loved ones so it will just take a few minutes to get you covered today. \u200b SYM: Remember, we are going to ask for the sale immediately after providing the price.\u200b This is why a best practice during the discover process is to ask the budget question last to put yourself in a better position to successfully close because you have all your information you need to know to offer the right product based on the customers needs. SYM: Here are some more examples of an Empathy Close. \u200b SYM: PRICE. I know you\u2019re concerned about having this in place for your loved ones so it will just take a few minutes to get you covered today. \u200b SYM: PRICE, And I realize it has been difficult to find something that works for you, but I believe this will. It will only take a few more minutes to get you covered today.\u200b SYM: Notice that something they have in common is making the sale today.\u200b They also reference back to something that was discovered about the customer earlier in the call.\u200b SYM: These examples are in other people\u2019s words, take a moment to write down how you would word your empathy close.\u200b SYM: Again, let's say you\u2019ve completed the discovery process with Sonya and have determined that an $8,000 UCSL policy will best meet her needs.\u200b SYM: Take a moment to review the information and write down an Empathy Close you could use for Sonya.\u200b Remember, you should ask for the sale immediately after providing the price. SYM: Click the \u201cI\u2019m Ready!\u201d icon when you are ready to practice your empathy close.\u200b Trainee: ... SYM: Great job practicing your Empathy Close.

Thank you for calling Compassion. My name is [YOUR NAME]. How can I assist you today? SYM: Hi! I got a letter saying that my child is turning 16 today, and I thought I had to set up as an automated birthday gift. Every year he gets a birthday gift. Trainee: Thank you for being a sponsor and wanting to send a gift to your sponsored child. It's a wonderful way to show your care and support. SYM: Thank you. Do you want my account number or anything? Trainee: Yeah. May I know your sponsor number if you have it on hand? SYM: Yes, the number is X 1 Y 2 Z 3. Trainee: Thank you. Can you verify the first and last name on the account. SYM: Kim Reeves. Trainee: Alright, I have pulled up your account. And first, I would like to thank you for being part of Compassion since 2016 and for being a blessing to your two children. You do have Jim from Peru and Michael, that is from Rwanda. And with regards to the birthday gift, it looks like you haven\u2019t setup a birthday gift here on the account. The only thing that you have set up is the automatic withdrawal for your monthly sponsorship for the birthday gift. SYM: Okay. Trainee: Regrettably, we don't have it here on the account. That means you didn't send a birthday gift to your child because you don't have any automatic set up of birthday gifts. SYM: Well, I thought it was already set up. So, if you could set it up today as an automatic gift and I can make a payment today on it. You need a card? Trainee: Let me check it here on the account. You do have here a visa card ending in 5252. Is it the one that you are using? SYM: Yeah, that one's good to use. Can you put it for $40? Automated birthday gift? Trainee: Yeah. Thank you so much for that. That would be $40 annually. And since we didn't receive one for today, we will be making one time birthday gift today. And then the next one would be on November 17, 2024, right? SYM: To do one today and the one in November? Trainee: Yes. Because it takes two to three months before it will be reflected on the account or it will be given to the child. Is it only for your child in Peru or are we going to set up for the one that is from Rwanda, for a month? SYM: I thought you said that one was already on automated. Trainee: It was on the automated, but you already sent one on last May 2023. You also sent one-time payment of a one-time birthday gift, but it wasn't setup on the automated payment. SYM: Let me just wait on that right now. When is his birthday again? Trainee: Yeah, it looks like your child's birthday, Michael is in July. Do you want to set it up today? SYM: Yeah, I'll do that a little bit later. I just wanted to get this one done today because I got an email that today was his birthday. I missed it. How long is it going to take for the area there to get this for him? Trainee: Yeah, it takes two to three months before they will be receiving the gift that you have sent to them. SYM: All right. Trainee: I'll just submit it here. So that would be the $40 pretty gift or annual pretty gift into the account. SYM: All right. And you have it set up as automated now, right? Trainee: Yes, that is correct. SYM: All right, thank you. Trainee: Everything is set now. Is there anything else I could help you with? SYM: No, that's it. I appreciate it.
